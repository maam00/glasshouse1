    "market_brief": "Mortgage rates declined 15 basis points this month to 6.89%, providing favorable tailwinds as Opendoor maintains strong operational momentum with 22.2 homes sold daily and a 78.9% win rate. The company sits at 96% pacing toward its Q1 revenue target of $1B, indicating robust demand despite elevated rate environment. CEO Carnie's public comments supporting Trump's housing affordability initiatives signal potential policy alignment that could benefit iBuying adoption. With 63 days left in Q1, Opendoor appears well-positioned to meet guidance while inventory optimization continues.",

    "key_risk": "Problem inventory carrying $58.6M in unrealized losses could pressure margins if market conditions deteriorate or liquidation accelerates.",
    "key_catalyst": "Continued mortgage rate decline toward 6.5% would significantly expand buyer pool and accelerate inventory turnover heading into spring selling season.",
