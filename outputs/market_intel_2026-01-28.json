Opendoor is capitalizing on improved conditions with a strong 78.9% win rate and daily sales pace of 22.2 homes, putting Q1 revenue 96% on track toward the $1B target with 63 days remaining. The operational momentum is solid, but the company still carries $58.6M in unrealized losses from 455 stale properties that need resolution. Management's optimistic commentary on Trump's housing policies signals confidence in the regulatory and market environment ahead.",
