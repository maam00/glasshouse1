    "market_brief": "Mortgage rates declined 15 basis points this month to 6.89%, providing tailwinds as OPEN maintains strong operational momentum with a 78.9% win rate and 22.2 homes sold daily. The company is tracking at 96% of its Q1 revenue target with 63 days remaining, positioning for another solid quarter execution. CEO commentary praising Trump's housing affordability efforts signals management confidence in the policy environment, while problem inventory remains contained at $58.6M in unrealized losses. Operational excellence continues despite elevated rate environment, with critical risk exposure limited to just one market.",
    "sentiment": "bullish",
    "key_risk": "Problem inventory of 455 aging homes could pressure margins if market conditions deteriorate or sales pace slows.",
    "key_catalyst": "Continued mortgage rate decline below 6.5% would significantly expand buyer pool and accelerate inventory turnover.",
