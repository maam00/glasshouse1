    "market_brief": "Mortgage rates declined for the third consecutive week to 6.89%, providing a modest tailwind as the Fed maintains its hawkish pause with Powell speaking today. Opendoor's Q1 execution remains strong with 96% revenue pacing toward the $1B target and a solid 78.9% win rate, though 84 toxic homes are creating $58.6M in unrealized losses that need clearing. The company benefits from CEO Caruso's high-profile Trump housing comments generating positive momentum, but inventory management becomes critical with 63 days left in Q1. Powell's commentary today could shift rate expectations and impact OPEN's transaction velocity heading into February.",
    "sentiment": "neutral",
    "key_risk": "The 84 toxic homes sitting over 365 days represent significant margin compression risk if market conditions deteriorate before liquidation.",
    "key_catalyst": "Continued mortgage rate decline below 6.8% would accelerate buyer demand and help clear problem inventory while driving transaction volume.",
